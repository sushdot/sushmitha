🚧 ROAD-GUARDIAN
AIAG05 – Agentic AI–Enabled Pothole Repair Accountability System
📌 Problem Statement
Cities receive repeated pothole complaints because citizens cannot track repair progress and contractors are not accountable for delays or poor-quality work. This leads to unsafe roads, duplicate work orders, and loss of public trust.

💡 Solution
ROAD-GUARDIAN is an Agentic AI system that tracks potholes from detection to closure, monitors repair timelines, scores contractor performance, and provides transparent status updates for citizens and authorities.

🤖 Agent Workflow
Detection Agent: Registers and de-duplicates pothole reports

Lifecycle Agent: Tracks repair stages end-to-end

Performance Agent: Scores contractors based on SLA and quality

Alert Agent: Flags delays and repeat failures

Transparency Agent: Publishes repair timelines
